# ZITADEL Login UI

This is going to be our next UI for the hosted login. It's based on Next.js 13 and its introduced `app/` directory (currently beta).

The Login UI should provide the following functionality:

- **Login API:** Request and Submit state to the Login API
- **Server Components:** Making server-first the default even for the most dynamic applications.
- **Streaming:** Display instant loading states and stream in updates (Register with [Liquid](https://liquidjs.com/))

## Running Locally

1. Install dependencies: `yarn install`
1. Start the dev server: `yarn dev`
